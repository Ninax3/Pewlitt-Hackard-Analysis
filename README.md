# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
Management has requested two tables of employee information for their "Silver Tsunami" HR initiative that will provide data to prepare for the replacement of retired eligible employees company-wide. 

# Results
Management has specfically requested the two following tables - 
1. The number of employees eligible to retire by title. These are employees born between 1952 and 1955. The total number is 72,458 employees.

Other results include -
- There are seven titles across all departments that are included in the employees eligible for retirement. These are positions that will be needed to be replaced as eligible employees retire. 
- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are the two largest counts at 25,916 and 24,926, respectively.

- The retirement_titles table shows that over half (72,458/133,776 = 54%) of eligible retirement employess have held another position in the company.

# Summary
The analysis of the tables created show that there are not enough mentorship eligible employees to fill the positions of the retirement eligible employees. Additional queries/tables are recommended -
1. to increase the date range for the mentorship eligible employees from all of 1965 (dob) to 1956-1965, or similar. 
2. to identify seniority by title for employees who were born (dob) before 1965. 

These two additional queries/tables will produce employees that could be added to the mentorship eligible program.
